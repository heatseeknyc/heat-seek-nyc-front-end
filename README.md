#Heat Seek NYC Front End Styling
This repo is seperate from the main [Heat Seek NYC repo](https://github.com/heatseeknyc/heatseeknyc) and exists in order to design and create a new html layout and css stylesheets for the project.  All pages are static and once created and agreed upon will be incorporated into the main project. This repo also exists to serve as a styleguide for any future contributors to the project.
